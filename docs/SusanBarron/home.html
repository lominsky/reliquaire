			<p class="homeTopText"><span id="homeDropCapsU">U</span>sing the computer to introduce the art work of Susan Barron is the very antithesis of this work&#8217;s sensibility. Her images are small, dense, finely detailed&mdash;multi-layered in every respect. A measured encounter with originals is mandatory for a realistic interpretation, not a hurried glance at inauthentic digital images. This site invites curators from museums, libraries and other venues to seek out the original works.</p>

			<p><span class="dropCaps">T</span>here exists in the work of Susan Barron an inti-​macy of subject, a delicacy of scale, a seductive aesthetic and a perfection of execution unsurpassed by any of our artists at work today.<br>

			<p><span class="dropCaps">T</span>o enter the exhibition from the noise of the street filled with blunt and aggressive visual messages and be confronted with quietness, subtlety and sophistication of Susan Barron&#8217;s books  is an overwhelming experience. No new techniques or materials flaunted here. What is remarkable is the perfection of execution, underlined by the quality which manifests the utmost refinement and craftsmanship. Going through LABYRINTH OF TIME like a meditation is an intimate, engaging and uplifting experience. We are enticed into the realm of mystery and magic, into a world we do not want to  leave. This is a unique experience in contemporary art.<br>

			<p><span class="dropCaps">S</span>ome of the work&#8217;s impressiveness is its refusal to im-press by force. The images offer a stubborn authority, an unrelenting sureness and maturity. Pressed into the work is an echo of profound experience and subtle originality. Each gesture is surprising in its breathtaking<!-- <span style="margin-left: 1px"> </span> --> freshness. <span class="attribution" style="margin-left: 33px">GENE BARO, Curator, Collage as Intimate Art</span></p><br>
