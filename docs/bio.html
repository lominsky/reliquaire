			<p><span class="dropCaps">S</span>usan Barron was born and grew up north of Chicago. She received childhood training in music; graduated from the University of Illinois (Urbana) in pre-medicine; completed advanced degrees in clinical diagnostic chemistry; resumed musical studies and was serendipitously introduced to visual arts by photographer Art Sinsabaugh; lived and photographed in Europe for four years before relocating to New York City in 1974; worked in the field of clinical chemistry until 1994 in order not to compromise art work; now devoting all time to art, making collages, drawings, etchings and other ink prints, as well as photographs. Despite its medieval tendencies, Barron&rsquo;s work is listed in both editions (1993 &amp; 2000) of <i>A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes</i>.</p>

			<p><span id="bioDropCapsA">A</span><span style="font-size: 10; padding-right: 25px">&nbsp;</span>monograph entitled ANOTHER SONG was published in 1981. <span style="font-size: 8; padding-right: 35px">&nbsp;</span>The limited-edition, hand-made volume contains forty original photographs tipped into an elegant binding. The work inspired a poem by John Cage, which was written especially for this sequence of pictures. The book was shown at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and twice at both the Philadelphia Museum of Art and The Israel Museum. It was also featured in the Art Journal&#8217;s &#8216;Artists and Writers: Collaborations of the 20th Century&#8217;. Complete wall exhibitions of ANOTHER SONG have taken place at the University of Illinois Krannert Art Museum, University of Iowa Museum of Art, Drexel University, The Southeast Museum of Photography, St. Louis Center for Contemporary Arts, Smith College, and Printworks Gallery, Chicago, which was her first non-museum show in eighteen years.</p>

			<p><span class="dropCaps">L</span>ABYRINTH OF TIME, her fifth book, <span style="padding-left: 2px">was</span> completed after a nine-year evolution. The eleven, full leather bound, conventional-looking volumes contain seventy-seven works-on-paper that open up and unfold to one hundred and fifty-two feet during exhibition. Specially designed cases with fiber-optic lighting display each outstretched volume. All her books  contain the originals, not printed reproductions, allowing the viewer to maintain an authentic encounter during the course of reading. The manuscript premiered as a solo exhibition at the Newberry Library of Chicago, traveling on to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and London&#8217;s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. LABYRINTH OF TIME has been met with an enthusiastic critical response in all venues. An academic tour is being planned.</p>

			<p><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ther major works include TWISTING SILENCE, MIRROR (her poem transcribed into Braille), and  JAMAICA MISTAKE (seven drawings with seven poems embedded in the officially recognized urtext of Creation&#8217;s seven days), SENZA ANCORA and EXPE. CASTING MEMORY (a girdle book) is scribed onto windowpane vellum in a variant of 6th C. Insular scrip. The binding is made out of the artist&#8217;s own hip bone.  She is currently working on a deck of cards and a classic Roman alphabet. Barron works from a studio in Brooklyn. To arrange to view original works, refer to the contact page.</p>

			<p>The Newberry Library of Chicago has established an artist&#8217;s archive of Barron&#8217;s papers and work.</p>
